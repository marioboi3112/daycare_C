# What is DayCare?

**DayCare** is a 2D horror game that i have been working on for a month now (since July of 2024).

# What is Raylib.

Raylib is a very popular game library/framework primarily built for making games in C or C++. But different
bindings have been made for the library (Nim, Lua, Haxe, Java, C# and so on).

The library can be found from this link -> <a href="https://www.raylib.com/"> Raylib </a>
